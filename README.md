# Recommended Crews

This is a list of popular crew set ups by ship with an explanation of why it is good and what it covers. 
Crews are ordered by order of effectiveness.

General crewing advise:

* Spock on Enteprise gets booted by Lumy.
* Don't use Yuki against Enteprirses.
* Don't use Marcus against non-explorers.
* Don't use Kang against non-interceptors.
* Don't use Charv against non-battleships.
* Main idea, should always be to increase you mitigation or decrease the opponents mitigation.
* Try to always be inverse triangle covered.
* If you get a G4 ship, try not to take it out until you have 3 lower deck seats.
* If you know the opponent for sure will always only hit you with the same ship, just plain old anti-faction and anti-triangle. For example, if the opponent only hits you with an Enterprise, just pack Marcus, Mirek and Krell, or Yuki, Char and Yanagh, for an Augur.

## By ship

### D4

* **Lorca crew**:
  * **Bridge:** Lorca/Gorkon/Kang (C), Killy, Marcus
  * **Lower deck:** half defense half health, if odd number, favor defense.
  * **Description:** Since almost no one carries Kang by default Killy increases dodge and Marcus covers for Enterprises. Augurs don't stand a chance.

* **Quick fights:**
  * **Bridge:** Gorkon (C), Kahn, Kerla/Harrison
  * **Lower deck:** full attack.
  * **Description:** This crew is intended to do as much damage as soon as possible, but it dies quickly to Enterprises, so be careful.

* **KSM**:
  * **Bridge:** Kirk (C), Spock, Marcus
  * **Lower deck:** full defense.
  * **Description:** For some reason, this works fairly well. Good against Enterprises.
  
### Enterprise

* **TOS Crew**:
  * **Bridge:** TOS Kirk (C), TOS Uhura, Kahn
  * **Lower deck:** full defense.
  * **Description:** This crew can kill up to 7-8M Kelvins depending on you research. Specifically to be used on maxed Enterprises, the idea is to increase damage ASAP and start landing all of them as crits.

* **TOS Crew 2:**
  * **Bridge:** TOS Uhura (C), TOS Kirk, Kahn/Charv/Marcus
  * **Lower deck:** If Kahn, full attack, if Charv full health, if Marcus full defense.
  * **Description:** Simple, "screw your criticals". TOS Uhura also covers when fighting other Enterprises. Use Marcus when fighting other Enterprises, Charv for bigger Augurs, Kahn as a semi all-around.
  
* **Standard crew:**
  * **Bridge:** Kirk (C), Marcus, Kahn 
  * **Lower deck:** full defense.
  * **Description:** Generic Enteprise crew, good against other Enterprises.

* **Mitigation increase:**
  * **Bridge:** Marcus (C), Zhou, Kahn 
  * **Lower deck:** full defense.
  * **Description:** Increases mitigation, good for against enterprises, use only with high level Zhou.
  
* **Crazy crits:**
  * **Bridge:** TOS Sulu (C), TOS Kirk, Kahn
  * **Lower deck:** full attack.
  * **Description:** By round 3 or 4 you should be hitting 100% critical hits.
  
### Augur

* **Gergiou crew**:
  * **Bridge:** Gergiou (C), Tyler, Djaoki
  * **Lower deck:** half attack half health, if even number, favor health.
  * **Description:** Tyler increases damage a lot, Djaoki drops mitigation drastically, Georgiou has better burning chances than Nero and drops opponents stats.
  
### Kelvin

* **Generic all-around:
  * **Bridge:** Yuki (C), Marcus, Kang
  * **Lower deck:** full defense.
  * **Description:** Marcus and Yuki cover Valdores. Kang covers other Kelvins. No need to worry about Ktingas, too few of them outside this group.
  
### Ktinga

* **K3:**
  * **Bridge:** Krell (C), Kang, Kahn/Linkasa
  * **Lower deck:** full attack.
  * **Description:** Kelvin killer. Krell increases damage and does hull breach, Kang kills the dodge, Kahn gets more crits. Effective on most Valdores too **but only because of the default triangle**. Replace Kahn with Linkasa if Kahn is busy or if you average fight length is 4 rounds or less.
  
* **The big valdore problem:**
  * **Bridge:** Yuki (C), Marcus, Yanagh
  * **Lower deck:** full health.
  * **Description:** Got a big Valdore that simply outpowers you by several million? This kills it.
  
### Valdore
  
* **Generic all-around:
  * **Bridge:** Yuki (C), Marcus, Kang
  * **Lower deck:** full defense.
  * **Description:** Notice this is the same as the Kelvin all-around. This is because there are no Ktingas to cover for in this server.
  
### Korinar

* **Generic all-around:**
  * **Bridge:** Char (C), Djaoki, Marcus/Kang
  * **Lower deck:** full health.
  * **Description:** Inevitably, Newtons will start cropping up, Char an Djaoki cover for those. Marucs is in case of big Valdores and Kang in case of big Kelvins and Pilums. If no Newtons are around, revert to generic all-around for Kelvin/Valdore.
  
## By use case

### Speed crews
* **Klaa crew:**
  * **Bridge:** Klaa (C), Komal, Kras 
  * **Lower deck:** full attack.
  * **Description:** 35% impulse increase and does not make your ship a paper airplane.
  
* **Speed Burnahm:**
  * **Bridge:** Burnham (C), Gerogiou, Tyler
  * **Lower deck:** full attack.
  * **Description:** This actually packs a punch, it is not the top one because impulse buff is 35 flat rate.
  
* **Pan:**
  * **Bridge:** Pan (C), Rima, Navi 
  * **Lower deck:** full attack.
  * **Description:** This is a bad idea. +50% to impulse but will turn your ship into a paper airplane. Vash described this crew as "doing 120 in the freeway in the opposite lane while drunk". Fast but fragile.

### Swarms

* **Frankie-A Top Crew**:
  * **Bridge:** 5 of 10, Jaylah, Kang
  * **Lower deck:** full health.
  * **Description:** This requires high levels of research, so test it first, but it is ultimately the most effective crew for killing swarms without tiering up the ship a lot.

* **Regular Hunting**:
  * **Bridge:** Pike, Moreau, T’Laan/Jaylah/Chen
  * **Lower deck:** full defense.
  * **Description:** Regular hunting crew. However, there’s a trick here. 37+ swarms have different fire patterns based on level, choose your third member accordingly. For example, 46s fire a massive gun in round 13, so you dont focus on just winning focus on winning before round 13.
